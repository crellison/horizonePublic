# <img src="./horizons_logo.png" style="float: left;"> Horizone - Social Network for Horizons

An intercompany social networking platform for job opportunities, posting queries, and meeting contacts within the company and it's alumni community. Currently, the app is under development and the real repository is hidden. Once we launch, we plan to make its code public so the architecture may be used for other internal social networks in incubator and programming bootcamp alumni communities. 

In the meantime, we have included a series of PDFs that should elucidate the design concepts and underlying functionality of the site (at least as we picture it in its most basic form).
